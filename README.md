# Around The World

Around The World is a social media site focusing on travel, so users can share where theyâ€™ve been, see where their friends are exploring, and find their next adventure. We want to consolidate the social media part of traveling to a single place where users can have a one-stop shop for their bucket-list travel adventures.
